# Solving a system of linear algebraic equations

Using the Python programming language, create your own computer program for 
solving system 3 (three) linear algebraic equations of the form:

using the Gauss-Seidel method!

Input should be set as constant values within the source program, not 
loaded from the keyboard or from a file. Before performing iterations, the 
program should check whether the system matrix is diagonally dominant, and 
print the information on the screen.

If the system matrix is not diagonally dominant, stop program 
execution.
In case the system matrix is diagonally dominant, start performing 
iterations
